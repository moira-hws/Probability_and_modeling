##  (Questions 1-10)    Sample spaces, experiments, and outcomes

## [1]  Define a sample space for ending up at a red or green light

## [2]  Simulate an experiment of this over 80 trials, assuming p(red) = .3 and p(green) = .7

## [3]  How many times was the light green?

## [4]  Is this more or less than you would expect?  Explain your reasoning.

## [5]  Define a sample space for encountering heavy or light traffic and rain or no rain

## [6]  What principle did (or at least could) you use to determine the size of the sample space in #5?

## [7]  Create a vector of weights when heavy traffic/no rain is .4, heavy traffic/rain is .2, light traffic/rain is .3, and light traffic/no rain is .1

## [8]  Simulated over 60 trials, how many times do you observe light traffic/no rain?

## [9]  What is the probability of observing light traffic if we know it is raining?

## [10] What's the "condition" in #9?  Does this expand or shrink the sample space from #5?

##  (Questions 11-15)    Factorials, permutations, combinations (use functions from part 1)

## [11] Judging an art contest with 15 entries, how many ways can you assign 1st and 2nd place?

## [12] How many ways can you arrange 11 math books on a shelf?

## [13] From a standard deck of 52 cards, how many hands of size 5 can be drawn?

## [14] What is the probability that a 5-card hand contains a 5, a 2, a Jack, an Ace, and a 10?

## [15] What is the probability that a 5-card hand contains three Kings?
