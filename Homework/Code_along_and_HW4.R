# Uniform -----------------------------------------------------------------

## uniform pdf


## uniform pdf for calculating probabilities in a range


## uniform cdf for calculating probabilities less than x


# Suppose that the mean annual temperature for a location was uniformly distributed, 
# between 10 degrees C and 18 degrees C, implying that each year any temperature in 
# this range is equally likely to be the mean for the year.  (Note that this is an unrealistic example, in the sense that mean temperatures are not likely to have this kind of distribution.)
# 
# [1] What is the probability that the annual temperature is less than 14 degrees C?


# [2] What is the probability that the mean annual temperature is between 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C?




# Normal -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## z scores


# If commuting times are normally distributed with mean 30 minutes, and standard deviation 16 minutes:
#
# [1] Find the probability that a commute is shorter than 35 minutes.


# [2] Find the probability that a commute time is between 40 and 50 minutes.


# [3] find the probability that a commute time is less than 17 minutes.


# [4] find the probability that a commute time is between 25 and 45 minutes.



# Exponential ------------------------------------------------------------------

## exponential pdf


## exponential cdf


# The distance of residential moves is found to be exponential, with lambda = 0.1 km.
# 
# [1] Find the probability that a residential move is less than 5 km.


# [2] Find the probability that a residential move is longer than 3 km.


# [3] Find the probability that a residential move is between 3 and 8 km.

## [1]  If the probability that an individual moves outside of their county of 
##      residence in a given year is 0.15, what is the probability that: 
##
##      a) fewer than 3 out of a sample of 10 move outside the country?
##
##      b) at least one moves outside the county?


## [2]  Two evenly matched baseball teams play the first four games in a 'best-of-seven'
##      series (where the first to win four games wins the series).  What is the
##      probability that:
##
##      a) team A will win exactly one of the first four games?
##
##      b) the series will be over after four games?
##
##      c) the series will have one team leading three games to one after four games?
##
##      d) the series will be tied two games apiece, after four games?


## [3]  The annual probability of moving is 0.17.
##
##      a) What is the probability that a person moves for the first time in the
##         first year of observation?
##
##      b) What is the probability that a person moves for the first time in the
##         fourth year of observation?
##
##      c) What is the mean time it takes for an individual to move?
##
##      d) What is the variance of the time it takes for a person to move?
##
##      e) Among 10 people, what is the probability that three or fewer move in 
##         a given year?


## [4]  One hundred people each have a probability of 0.01 of contracting a disease.
##      What is the probability that two or fewer out of 100 get the disease?
##      Use both the binomial and Poisson distributions.  Which distribution is more
##      appropriate, and which serves as an approximation?


## [5]  Use the hypergeometric distribution to determine which lottery gives you
##      the better chance to win:
##
##      a) Choose four balls from a box of 34.  You win if you match three or four balls.
##
##      b) Choose five balls from a box of 25.  You win if you match four or five balls.


## [6]  Snowfall for a location is found to be normally distributed with a mean of 96"
##      and standard deviation of 36".
##
##      a) What is the probability that a given year will have more than 120" of snow?
##
##      b) What is the probability that the snowfall will be between 90" and 100"?
##
##      c) What level of snowfall will be exceeded only 10% of the time?


## [7]  A variable X is uniformly distributed between 10 and 24.  
##
##      a) What is Pr(16 <= X <= 20)?
##
##      b) What is the mean and variance of X?


## [8]  The duration of residence for households is found to be exponentially distributed
##      with lambda = 0.21.  What is the probability that a family
##
##      a) is in their house for more than eight years?
##
##      b) is in their house between five and eight years?
##
##      c) moves in the next year, given that they have been in the house for eight years?


## [9]  The number of customers at a bank each day is found to be normally distributed with
##      mean mu = 250 and standard deviation sigma = 110.
##
##      a) What fraction of days will have less than 100 customers?
##
##      b) More than 320?


## [10] Incomes are exponentially distributed with lambda = 0.0001.  What fraction
##      of the population has income
##
##      a) < $8000?
##
##      b) > $12000?
##
##      c) between $9000 and $12000?
