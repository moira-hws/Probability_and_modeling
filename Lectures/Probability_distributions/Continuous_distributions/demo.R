# uniform cdf


# Suppose that the mean annual temperature for a location was uniformly distributed, 
# between 10 degrees C and 18 degrees C, implying that each year any temperature in 
# this range is equally likely to be the mean for the year.  (Note that this is an unrealistic example, in the sense that mean temperatures are not likely to have this kind of distribution.)
# 
# [1] What is the probability that the annual temperature is less than 14 degrees C?


# [2] What is the probability that the mean annual temperature is between 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C?

# [1] Find the probability that a commute is shorter than 35 minutes.


# [2] Find the probability that a commute time is between 40 and 50 minutes.


# [3] find the probability that a commute time is less than 17 minutes.


# [4] find the probability that a commute time is between 25 and 45 minutes.

# The distance of residential moves is found to be exponential, with lambda = 0.1 km.
# 
# [1] Find the probability that a residential move is less than 5 km.


# [2] Find the probability that a residential move is longer than 3 km.


# [3] Find the probability that a residential move is between 3 and 8 km.
# subtract the probability that a move is less than 3 km from the probability that
# a move is less than 8 km
